        <h1> Welcome to The Number Guessing Game! </h1>

        <!-- This is the description of how to play the game, it will be fun -->
        <div id="Works">
            <p><b>How It Works:</b> This program will choose a number ranging from 1 to 100.</p>
            <p>You have seven attempts at guessing what the number is but, don't worry there will be hints.
                 If you would like to see the blog for this assignment <a href="HW2Blog.md" target="_blank"> Click Here </a>.<br></br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Hints:</b> If the number you guess is higher then the choosen number, the number of attempts left will turn
                Red
            </p>
            <p>If the number you guess is lower then the chooen number, the number of attempts left turns blue. </p>
