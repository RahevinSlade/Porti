# Rahevin's HW3 Blog

Below are the requirements for homework 3

1. Uses Git branching, all commits are done on branch HW3
```
git branch
git checkout HW3
git add .
git commit -m "Example, Node-bodies code here"
git push origin HW3
```

2. Commits show that code was written from scratch

![CLICK ME](png/pdf name) to view the image showing all commits, or you can just view my git hub.

3. Code Compiles,
![CLICK ME](png/pdf name) to view a side by side screen shot of my code vs Scot Morses code. ("Ding-Ding, round 1").

4. Built in typenames like string and object are lowercase

Bits from Calculator.cs code(bits of code not in order, just a demostration of the requirment)
```
string userinput;
double a = 0.0;
double b = 0.0;
double c = 0.0;
```

Bits from the Node.cs code
```
public Node(Object data, Node next){
    esc...
}
```
5. Method names and public fields start with Upper case, private and local variables start with lower case
```
Public string PostFixInput(string userinput)
{
    string e;//this will be our error message at the end
    string s;//determines the action for the two doubles
}

```
